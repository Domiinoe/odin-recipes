# odin-recipes
First Odin project: recipe website
For my first project, I had to create a website with multiple webpages containing 3 different recipes which can be accessed from my website's homepage.
I showcased the use of several elements such as: heading, link, lists and embedding images as well as sizing them. I also practised writing commit messages and pushing my work onto GitHub.
